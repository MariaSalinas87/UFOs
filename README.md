UFOs
Overview on the Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

Results
Once the index is clicked on, it will take you the UFO sightings webpage with title The Truth is Out There.  Towards the Bottom left you will see the filter Search Box

In the search box you will choose your criteria and Filter Table. The result will show on the right.

As the picture above shows, the filter table works and displays the date and criteria searched. 

Summary 
I believe a drawback of the webpage is that it is only using the information from a limited file as opposed to using an API like google. When someone tries to use a city like Wesley Chapel in Florida, it wont return any results because it is not part of the database used.

Recommendations
1.	I would recommend to use APIs to retrieve real-time data instead of retrieving from database that may have limited data.
2.	 I would recommend creating a database instead of using a file to gather information.
